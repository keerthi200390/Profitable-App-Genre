# Profitable-App-Genre
My goal in this project is to find the genre(ex: Games, Books, News etc) of app's that will be profitable on both Google Play and the iOS App Store markets.This will help freelance app developers to make better data driven decision on the kind of apps they would like to develop to be profitable.
